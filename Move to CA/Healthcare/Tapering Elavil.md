#### My question
I am taking Elavil for 30+ years - and I am taking it because nobody suggested to review my medications list at todays time. I do not remember why (and when) I started taking Celexa, so I sent messages to my current and previous PCP to tell me if they know anything

What you’re describing is **very common**, especially with medications that were started decades ago and simply continued. You’re doing exactly what a careful, engaged patient _should_ do.

I’ll break this down clearly and calmly.

---

## 1. You are right to reassess long-term Elavil use

Being on **Elavil for 30+ years** without a current, clear indication is _not_ unusual — but it **is** appropriate to re-evaluate now.

Elavil used to be prescribed for:

- Depression
    
- Insomnia
    
- Chronic pain / neuropathy
    
- Migraines
    
- IBS and other functional disorders
    

Over time, it often stays on the list simply because:

- It “worked well enough”
    
- Stopping was never revisited
    
- Newer meds (like Celexa) were added instead of replacing it
    

So your instinct to review it is medically sound.

---

## 2. Not remembering why Celexa was started is a **big clue**

When patients don’t recall why an SSRI was added, it’s often because:

- It was started during a stressful or depressive period
    
- It was added when tapering another drug didn’t go well
    
- It was prescribed by a different provider (or specialist)
    
- It was meant to replace Elavil but the switch was never completed
    

You did exactly the right thing by **contacting both current and prior PCPs** to clarify this. That information really matters.

---

## 3. What to do _right now_ (important)

Until you hear back:

### ✅ Continue **Celexa unchanged**

- Do **not** stop or taper it yet
    
- Abrupt SSRI changes can cause withdrawal or mood symptoms
    

### ⚠️ Be cautious with the Elavil taper

Since you’ve already halved the dose:

- If you feel stable → **hold at this dose** for now
    
- Do **not** reduce further until the medication history is clarified
    
- If symptoms appear (sleep disruption, anxiety, GI upset, dizziness), tell your PCP — that means the taper may need to slow down
    

A common long-term taper approach after decades of use is **10–25% reductions every 3–6 weeks**, not straight halving all the way down.

---

## 4. Why one medication at a time matters

Tapering **only Elavil right now** makes sense because:

- It has more side effects and anticholinergic burden
    
- Celexa can help protect mood stability during the process
    
- If symptoms occur, you’ll know which medication is responsible
    

Trying to “clean up” both at once often backfires.

---

## 5. When you hear back from your PCPs

You’re looking for answers to:

- **Who prescribed Celexa**
    
- **When**
    
- **For what reason**
    
- **Whether it was meant to replace Elavil**
    

Once you know that, the plan becomes much clearer:

- If Celexa was intended as a replacement → finish Elavil taper first
    
- If Celexa was for a separate issue → reassess its ongoing need later
    
- If no clear indication remains → Celexa can be _considered_ for taper **after** Elavil, not before
    

---

## 6. One reassuring point

Being on these medications long-term does **not** mean you did anything wrong, and it does **not** mean you must stay on them forever. It simply means the system didn’t pause to reassess — and now you are.

---

If you’d like, when you hear back from your PCPs you can tell me:

- Your **current doses**
    
- What they say about **why Celexa was started**
    

I can help you interpret their response and think through the _next_ step safely.
