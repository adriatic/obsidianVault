Organizing the move to Roseville CA, where Vesna already works at Kaiser Permanente last three weeks, was a lot more tasking than I anticipated. The fact that I continue to be Lada’s caretaker, did make my role easier.

Now, we are flying to Sacramento early tomorrow morning. We found a very similar senior living facility to all seasons here in Ann Arbor, so the whole purpose of this trip is to ease Vesna’s worries for her old parents being thousands of miles away.

Thank for wonderful worry free life you gave me

Best regards Nik
