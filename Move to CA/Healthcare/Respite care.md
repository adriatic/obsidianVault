## Will Banner Life Insurance Cover the Cost of Respite Care at Home?

### **What Is Banner Life Insurance?**

Banner Life Insurance, now part of Legal & General America (LGA), primarily offers **term life insurance** and **universal life insurance** policies. These products are designed to pay a **death benefit** to your beneficiaries if you pass away while the policy is active. They are **not health insurance** and are **not long-term care (LTC) insurance**.[1][2]

### **Does Banner Life Insurance Cover Respite Care?**

**No, Banner Life Insurance does not directly cover the cost of respite care at home** (or in any setting) as part of its standard life insurance policies. Banner Life’s policies are financial safety nets—they pay a lump sum to your beneficiaries upon your death, but **do not provide reimbursement or direct payment for ongoing medical, custodial, or respite care expenses** during your lifetime.[2][3][1]

### **What Insurance Does Cover Respite Care?**

- **Long-Term Care Insurance:** If you have a **long-term care insurance policy** (not a life insurance policy), it may cover respite care, either at home or in a facility, depending on the specific terms of your policy. In California, for example, “Home Care Only” and “Comprehensive” LTC policies must include respite care as a benefit, provided you meet the policy’s eligibility requirements (such as being unable to perform a certain number of activities of daily living).[4][5]
- **Medicare:** Traditional Medicare covers **respite care only under the hospice benefit** for terminally ill patients, and even then, it is limited to care in a Medicare-approved facility, not at home. **Medicare does not cover respite care at home for non-hospice situations.**[6][7][8]
- **Medicare Advantage:** Some Medicare Advantage plans (Part C) may offer additional respite care benefits, including in-home options, but coverage varies widely by plan.[7][6]
- **Medicaid:** Medicaid, including California’s Medi-Cal, may cover respite care through home and community-based services waivers for eligible individuals.[9][4]
- **Private Health Insurance:** Most private health insurance plans do **not** cover respite care unless specifically stated in the policy.

### **What Can You Do If You Need Respite Care and Have Banner Life Insurance?**

- **Review Your Life Insurance Policy:** Carefully read your Banner Life Insurance policy documents. While the death benefit is payable to your beneficiaries, there is no provision for paying for ongoing care expenses like respite care.
- **Explore Other Funding Options:** Look into **long-term care insurance** if you have it, **Medicare Advantage plans**, **Medicaid/Medi-Cal waivers**, **veterans benefits**, or **local community programs** that may offer financial support for respite care.[4][6][9]
- **Contact Banner Health (Unrelated to Banner Life Insurance):** **Banner Health** is a healthcare provider and offers Medicare/Medicaid-certified home care, but this is a separate entity from Banner Life Insurance and does not provide coverage for respite care unless you meet specific Medicare or Medicaid criteria for skilled nursing or therapy needs.[10][11]

## **Bottom Line**

**Banner Life Insurance does not cover the cost of respite care at home.** Its policies are designed to pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries, not to reimburse or pay for ongoing care expenses during your lifetime. If you need financial assistance for respite care, explore long-term care insurance, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid/Medi-Cal waivers, veterans benefits, or local community programs—these are the primary avenues for respite care funding. Always review your specific policy documents or consult with a licensed insurance agent for personalized advice.[6][9][4]
