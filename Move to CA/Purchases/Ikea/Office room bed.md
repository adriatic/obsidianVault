The **IKEA Brimnes daybed** is specifically designed to transform easily from a single (twin) bed into a double bed, making it a versatile space-saving solution for small rooms, guest bedrooms, or multipurpose spaces.

## How the Conversion Works

- **Pull-out mechanism**: The Brimnes daybed comes with a pull-out bed base (trundle). When configured as a single bed, the second mattress sits beneath the top mattress within the frame. To convert it to a double bed, simply pull the trundle out—the second mattress rises and lies next to the first mattress, creating a double sleeping surface[1][2].
- **Mattress arrangement**: The daybed requires **two twin mattresses**. These are stacked on top of each other when used as a single bed. When extended, they are placed side by side to form the double bed[1][2].
- **Support and comfort**: The included slatted bed base supports both mattresses, whether in single or double configuration. You should use mattresses of the recommended thickness for best results.
- **Storage**: The Brimnes features two large drawers under the bed, providing ample storage for bedding and linens, which is especially useful when you need extra blankets or pillows for guests[1][2].

## Important Notes

- **Not two separate beds**: The Brimnes daybed is not designed to support two independent single beds (such as trundle beds in some other product lines). The mattresses are only used side-by-side when the bed is pulled out for double use[1][2].
- **Assembly**: Follow the assembly instructions carefully, especially when attaching the trundle mechanism. Step-by-step video guides are available online for clarity[3][4].
- **Mattress selection**: Only certain mattress thicknesses will fit the Brimnes well (IKEA's Ågotnes firm foam mattresses are commonly paired with this model)[2].

## DIY and Hacks

While the official function is as a daybed-to-double-bed, some users have created custom built-ins or additional storage solutions around the Brimnes frame, but these are not required for basic double-bed functionality[5].

## Summary Table

| Configuration        | Mattress Arrangement           | Sleeping Surface | Usage                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Single/Twin mode     | Mattresses stacked vertically | Single           | Everyday use, sofa, daybed   |
| Double mode          | Mattresses side-by-side       | Double           | Overnight guests, couple use |

**In summary:**  
The IKEA Brimnes twin bed transforms into a bed for two by simply pulling out the trundle base, allowing the second mattress to sit next to the first. No modification is needed beyond what the product provides—just follow the instructions and ensure you have two compatible twin mattresses[1][2]. This design is ideal for maximizing small spaces and accommodating overnight guests.
