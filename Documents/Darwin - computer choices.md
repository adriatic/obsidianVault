### **Key Observations**

- **All-in-One** options come with integrated monitors, keyboards, and mice—ideal for simplicity and space savings.
- **Desktop** options are typically sold as towers only; you must add a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (sometimes bundled, but always confirm). For comparison, I’ve estimated an additional $100–$200 for a basic monitor and peripherals, but actual prices will vary.
- **Gaming desktops** (e.g., iBUYPOWER) are priced higher due to powerful GPUs and larger storage.
- **Apple Mac mini** is included as a desktop, but requires separate purchase of display and accessories.
- **Availability** and exact configurations may change, so always verify on Best Buy’s website or in-store before purchase.

### **Total Cost Comparison**

To fairly compare **all-in-one** versus **desktop** systems, remember that desktops require a separate monitor and peripherals. Here’s a quick estimate for a typical desktop setup:

- **Desktop tower**: $349.99–$1,499.99
- **Monitor**: ~$100–$300+ (depending on size and features)
- **Keyboard/mouse**: ~$20–$100 (if not bundled)

**All-in-one** systems start around $379.99 and include everything, making them very cost-effective for basic needs. **Desktops** offer more flexibility and potential performance, but at a higher total cost when peripherals are added.
