## Banner Life LTC Coverage of Home Respite Care

**Banner Life Insurance Company** is primarily known for life insurance products—especially term and universal life insurance—rather than stand-alone long-term care (LTC) insurance. Available evidence indicates that Banner Life’s main insurance offerings do **not** include comprehensive long-term care policies that explicitly cover home respite care. However, if you purchased a **LTC insurance policy** from Banner Life more than 20 years ago, it is possible you hold a specialized product no longer widely issued today, as the insurance market has changed significantly over the past two decades.[1][2]

### **State of California Requirements for LTC Policies**

California law mandates that true “Comprehensive Long-Term Care Insurance” policies must cover **respite care**—short-term relief for primary caregivers—as part of their benefits. Such policies must also cover **home health care, adult day care, personal care, homemaker services, and hospice services** when a Plan of Care is established by a doctor or medical team. Respite care can be provided in a **nursing facility, at home, or in a community-based program**. If your Banner Life policy is a **California-compliant, comprehensive LTC policy**, then it should include home respite care coverage, assuming all policy conditions and Plan of Care requirements are met.[3]

### **How To Verify Your Coverage**

- **Review Your Policy Documents:** Carefully read your certificate of insurance or policy contract to see if **respite care**—and specifically **home respite care**—is listed as a covered benefit.
- **Contact Banner Life:** To get a definitive answer about what your specific policy covers, call Banner Life’s customer service (1-800-638-8428) and ask directly about **respite care coverage** and whether it extends to in-home respite services.
- **Check for a Plan of Care Requirement:** Most LTC policies require a **Plan of Care** (developed by your doctor or medical team) before respite care benefits are paid. Make sure you have this documentation if you intend to make a claim.[3]
- **If You Need a Claim:** If your policy **does** cover home respite care, follow Banner Life’s claims process as outlined in your policy, and be prepared to provide supporting medical documentation and details of your respite care arrangement.

### **Key Takeaway**

If your **Banner Life policy is a true long-term care insurance policy** (a specialized product no longer typical for Banner but potentially issued 20+ years ago), and if it was written in California or another state with similar requirements, **it likely covers home respite care** provided all policy conditions are met. However, **Banner Life’s current main product offerings do not include standalone LTC insurance or respite care benefits**.[2][1][3]

**To be certain,** review your policy documents, contact Banner Life directly with your policy number in hand, and ask specifically about home respite care coverage. This is the only way to confirm your exact benefits, as policy language and coverage can vary widely—especially for older, less common policies.
