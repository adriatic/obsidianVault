If you’re looking to scan **multiple pages** into a single document using the Scanner Pro app on your iPhone — excellent choice! It’s like turning a stack of paper into a neat e-book in a few taps. Here’s a playful yet precise walkthrough to help you do it smoothly:

### ✅ Step-by-step: Creating a multi-page scan

1. Open **Scanner Pro** on your iPhone.
    
2. Tap the **“+” (plus)** button (usually at the bottom right) to start a new scan. ([Readdle](https://support.readdle.com/scannerpro/view-manage-the-scans/create-a-multi-page-scan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create a multi-page scan | Scanner Pro Knowledge Base"))
    
3. Position your iPhone’s camera over the first page of your document.
    
    - The app will automatically detect edges and correct perspective (nice!). ([iPhone J.D.](https://www.iphonejd.com/iphone_jd/2016/04/review-scanner-pro-7-readdle.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Review: Scanner Pro 7 by Readdle — the best way to scan ..."))
        
    - You can either let it capture automatically or tap the shutter button yourself. ([Readdle](https://support.readdle.com/scannerpro/view-manage-the-scans/create-a-multi-page-scan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create a multi-page scan | Scanner Pro Knowledge Base"))
        
4. After capturing the first page, you’ll see an option/icon to **“Add page”** (or keep scanning) so you can continue through your second, third, etc. pages.

5. Once you’ve scanned all the pages you need, tap the indicator (bottom right) that shows how many pages you have. Then tap **Save** to store the document as one file.

### 🔧 Helpful extras & tips

- If you’ve already scanned some pages **separately**, you can merge them into one file:
    
    - Open Scanner Pro → **Select** multiple scans → tap **Merge** → give it a name → Done. ([Readdle](https://support.readdle.com/scannerpro/view-manage-the-scans/create-a-multi-page-scan?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create a multi-page scan | Scanner Pro Knowledge Base"))
        
- To make sure when you share/export the scan it remains **one file**, choose PDF format (not JPEG). If you share in JPEG, each page may get sent as a separate file. ([Readdle](https://support.readdle.com/scannerpro/troubleshooting/multipage-scans-are-shared-as-separate-files?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Multipage scans are shared as separate files | Scanner Pro ..."))
    
- Under the app’s “Tips & Tricks” section: you can reorder pages, change color mode (black & white, photo, grayscale), crop, rotate, etc. ([Readdle](https://support.readdle.com/scannerpro/view-manage-the-scans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "View & Manage your scans | Scanner Pro Knowledge Base"))
    
- If you’re scanning a book (e.g., two pages open), there's even a **Book Mode** that captures two pages at once and splits them nicely. ([Readdle](https://readdle.com/scannerpro/how-to-scan-a-book?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Scanner Pro scanning book guide"))

### 🧠 Pro tips for better scans

- Place the pages on a **flat, well-lit surface** so the camera detects the edges well.
    
- Try to avoid shadows or reflections — the app handles some correction, but starting clean helps.
    
- After the scan, give your document a meaningful name and maybe export/upload (to iCloud, Google Drive, etc.) so you don’t lose it.
