### [Introducing Serverless Inference on the GenAI Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/gen-ai-new-serverless-inference)

DigitalOcean’s new AI platform, now called the **DigitalOcean GradientAI Platform** (formerly GenAI Platform), is designed to make integrating AI into your applications fast, simple, and scalable.

Key features and highlights:

- **Serverless Inference**:
    
    - Lets you access powerful AI models (from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta) via a single API.
        
    - No infrastructure to provision or manage—just use a unified API key, fixed endpoints, and centralized usage monitoring and billing.
        
    - Automatically scales for unpredictable workloads, supporting usage-based pricing with zero idle infrastructure cost.
        
    - It’s built for teams and developers who want full control and easy integration but don’t want the burden of infrastructure management.
        
- **Ideal Use Cases**:
    
    - SaaS tools (document summarization, tone/language enhancements)
        
    - E-commerce (smart search, recommendations, customer support)
        
    - Agencies (multi-client AI experiences)
        
    - Content platforms (real-time AI writing/editing)
        
    - EdTech (dynamic tutoring or grading using LLMs)
        
    - Customer service automation (stateless AI support tasks)
        
- **How it works**:
    
    - You integrate AI models into your apps without worrying about setup or scalability.
        
    - Designed for rapid prototyping, public preview allows you to get started quickly.
        
- **Availability**:
    
    - The serverless inference feature is available now in public preview, and the platform offers predictable real-world pricing.
        

This platform reduces the typical complexity of deploying AI by consolidating providers and infrastructure management under one roof, so you can focus on building features rather than managing backend systems[1](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/gen-ai-new-serverless-inference).
