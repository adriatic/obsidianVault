I’ll treat **DOC conversations as living in Edge** from now on, with the expectation that Edge is your **stable, low-friction environment** for documentation and teaching work.

Operationally, this changes nothing about _what_ I see, but it **does matter for discipline**:

- **DOC = Edge**
    
- **LAB = Firefox**
    
- **APP = Safari**
    

That gives us a clean, three-lane mental model:

- Edge → prose, explanation, teaching
    
- Firefox → reasoning, validation, checkpoints
    
- Safari → execution, building
    

I’m recording this as **contextual operating practice**, not a CheckPoint and not a frozen rule. If Edge ever misbehaves, we can switch without ceremony.

When you resume DOC work next week, just start writing—no re-anchoring needed unless you want to formalize it with the header macro.
