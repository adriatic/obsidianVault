## Project
Bitwarden Community Tool — prototype (working title)

## Current Goal
Finish a demo-capable prototype that demonstrates how ChatGPT can be used interactively and responsibly within a Bitwarden community context.

## What Was Accomplished So Far
- Defined and accepted a ChatGPT-assisted workflow suitable for security-focused open-source work
- Identified browser/session instability as a client-side issue, not an account limitation
- Established session handoff discipline to avoid throttling and context loss
- Continued work on the prototype application (details to be refined in next session)

## Current State of the Prototype
- Architecture: in-progress, demo-oriented
- Core idea: ChatGPT-assisted interaction for Bitwarden community use
- Prototype status: functional but not yet demo-polished
- Known gaps: documentation clarity, demo narrative, cleanup

## Open Decisions
- Final scope of the demo (what is shown vs. deferred)
- How much automation vs. explanation is shown in the demo
- How this will be presented to the Bitwarden community

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Resume in a fresh Safari ChatGPT session using this handoff
2. Clarify the exact demo scenario to support
3. Tighten the prototype only to the level required for demonstration

## Constraints / Guardrails
- No reliance on ChatGPT long-term memory
- No browser-dependent state
- Security-first, community-friendly assumptions
- Prototype > polish > production

## Questions for Next ChatGPT Session
- What is the minimal, convincing demo story for this prototype?
- What must work vs. what can be mocked or explained?

## How to Resume (for ChatGPT)
“Assume this handoff is the full context. Do not rely on any prior thread.”
