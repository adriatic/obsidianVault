### 🌲 **RedwoodJS** is absolutely the better long-term platform for our _real_ Bitwarden community app

And here is why:

 ✔ True opinionated full-stack framework

 ✔ React _and_ GraphQL _and_ Prisma wired together

 ✔ No ambiguous boundary between client/server

 ✔ Backend and frontend live together cleanly

✔ File structure enforces architecture

 ✔ Integrated generators

 ✔ Database-first mindset

   ✔ Authentication baked in (multiple providers supported)

 ✔ API-side is explicit, testable, and isolated

### ✔ Routing is deterministic, simple, and predictable

 ✔ Much easier to secure

 ✔ Much easier to reason about

 ✔ Much easier to contribute to as an open-source community project
