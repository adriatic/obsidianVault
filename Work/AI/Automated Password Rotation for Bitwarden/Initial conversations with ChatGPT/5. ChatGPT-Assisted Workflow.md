_(Prototype & Community-Ready Definition)_

## Purpose

This workflow defines how ChatGPT is used as an **interactive reasoning and collaboration assistant** while ensuring that:

- No work is lost due to browser or session instability
    
- All project knowledge remains **portable, auditable, and tool-agnostic**
    
- The workflow is suitable for **open-source and security-sensitive projects** (e.g., Bitwarden community tools)
    

ChatGPT is treated as a **thinking partner**, not a system of record.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. ChatGPT Has _No Long-Term Authority_

ChatGPT:

- Reasons
    
- Explains
    
- Proposes
    
- Reviews
    

ChatGPT does **not**:

- Store canonical state
    
- Act as project memory
    
- Replace documentation or version control
    

---

### 2. All Durable Knowledge Lives Outside ChatGPT

Authoritative artifacts are stored as:

- Markdown documents
    
- Git repositories
    
- Obsidian notes
    
- Design specs
    

ChatGPT output becomes durable **only after being saved externally**.

---

### 3. Sessions Are Intentionally Short-Lived

Each ChatGPT session is:

- Bounded in time
    
- Bounded in scope
    
- Disposable
    

Continuity is achieved via **handoff documents**, not browser history.

---

## Workflow Structure

### A. Session Start

At the beginning of a session, the user provides:

- The latest `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
    
- The immediate goal for this session
    

Instruction to ChatGPT:

> “Assume this handoff is the full context. Do not rely on any prior thread.”

---

### B. Active Collaboration Phase

ChatGPT may be used for:

- Architecture reasoning
    
- Threat modeling
    
- Design tradeoffs
    
- Code review and generation
    
- Clarifying requirements
    
- Preparing demo narratives
    

During this phase:

- No assumption is made that the session will persist
    
- Intermediate decisions are periodically summarized
    

---

### C. Session End (Mandatory)

Every productive session ends with:

- A generated or updated `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
    

The handoff captures:

- What was achieved
    
- What is incomplete
    
- What decisions are open
    
- What comes next
    

The session is then **intentionally abandoned**.

---

## Browser & Environment Discipline

### Defined Browser Roles

- **Safari (APP)**  
    Primary ChatGPT interaction environment
    
- **Firefox (LAB / DOC)**  
    GitHub, documentation, research, validation
    
- **Chrome**  
    Not used for ChatGPT (due to observed degradation)
    

Only **one browser** is used per ChatGPT session.

---

## Identity & Continuity Model

There is **no persistent identity** across browsers or threads.

Continuity is achieved via:

- Explicit handoff documents
    
- Optional human-readable session identifiers
    

Example:

`Session-ID: BW-PROTOTYPE-DEC18-A Contributor: Nik`

This provides orientation, not system memory.

---

## Failure-Resilient Design

If ChatGPT becomes slow or unresponsive:

1. Stop work immediately
    
2. Generate or manually write a handoff
    
3. Close the session
    
4. Resume later in a new session
    

No recovery is attempted within a degraded session.

---

## Security & Community Suitability

This workflow:

- Avoids hidden or implicit context
    
- Produces auditable artifacts
    
- Is compatible with code review
    
- Does not rely on proprietary memory features
    
- Can be adopted by any contributor
    

This makes it appropriate for:

- Bitwarden community tools
    
- Security-focused open-source projects
    
- Long-running collaborative efforts
    

---

## Definition Summary (One-Sentence)

> **ChatGPT is used as a stateless, interactive reasoning assistant, while all authoritative project state is maintained externally through explicit, versioned handoff documents.**

---

From this point forward, **this is the workflow I will assume by default** unless you explicitly say otherwise.

When you’re ready, the next logical steps could be:

- Tailoring this definition into a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    
- Binding it to your prototype’s demo narrative
    
- Creating a “ChatGPT Usage Policy” for the Bitwarden repo
    

But for now — this definition is solid, stable, and sufficient to finish the prototype.

Switching from Firefox accepting your recommendation in Firefox "Checkpoint now. Then decide fresh tomorrow." This means that I am accepting all your recommendations under the title "ChatGPT-Assisted Workflow" Please explain and do "Checkpoint Now" and tell me what do I need to do

Nik — good. By saying this, you have **formally locked in the workflow**.  
Now let’s do **“Checkpoint Now”** properly and concretely.

I’ll explain **what it means**, then give you a **precise checklist** of what _you_ need to do (nothing abstract).

---

# What “Checkpoint Now” Means (Plain English)

“Checkpoint Now” means:

> **Freeze the current state of thinking, decisions, and progress into an external artifact, then intentionally stop.**

Not:

- finishing the feature
    
- solving the next problem
    
- pushing harder
    

But:

- **making the work resumable**
    
- **preventing loss**
    
- **resetting browser + cognitive load**
    

This is a _professional stop_, not a failure stop.

---

# What We Are Checkpointing

You are checkpointing **three things**:

1. ✅ The **agreement** on the ChatGPT-Assisted Workflow
    
2. ✅ The **current state of your prototype effort** (even if incomplete)
    
3. ✅ A **clean resume point** for tomorrow, in Safari, without Firefox baggage
    

---

# What You Need To Do — Step by Step

## STEP 1 — Create the Handoff Document (10–15 minutes)

Create a new file locally (or in Obsidian):

`SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

Paste the template below **and fill it in yourself**.  
(Do not try to make it perfect.)

---

# SESSION HANDOFF

## Metadata
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Timezone: PST
- Thread: LAB | APP | DOC
- Browser: Firefox | Safari | Chrome
- Session Type: Checkpoint | Resume | Working
- Checkpoint ID: YYYYMMDD-HHMM-PST

## Project
- Name: Bitwarden Community Tool (prototype)
- Scope: Demo-capable prototype
- Audience: Bitwarden community

## Current Goal
<One paragraph. No bullets. No speculation.>

## Accepted Decisions (Frozen)
- Decision 1
- Decision 2
- Decision 3

## Explicit Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Item 1
- Item 2

## Current State
- Architecture:
- Prototype status:
- Known gaps:

## Open Decisions (Not Yet Agreed)
- Question 1
- Question 2

## Known Issues / Risks
- Issue 1
- Issue 2

## Resume Instructions
When resuming:
1. Re-read this document first
2. Do NOT revisit Accepted Decisions unless explicitly requested
3. Ask for confirmation before expanding scope

## Checkpoint Declaration
This session is checkpointed.
No new assumptions are allowed beyond this document.

---

## STEP 2 — Save It Somewhere Safe (2 minutes)

Choose **one**:

- Your project repo (`docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`)
    
- Obsidian vault
    
- A clearly named local folder
    

This file is now **the authoritative state**.

---

## STEP 3 — Stop _Intentionally_ (important)

Do **all three**:

1. Close the Firefox ChatGPT tab
    
2. Do **not** open another ChatGPT thread today
    
3. Do **not** “just check one more thing”
    

This is how you reset browser + session pressure.

---

## STEP 4 — Tomorrow’s Resume Procedure (Safari)

When you come back **tomorrow**, do exactly this:

1. Open **Safari**
    
2. Start a **new ChatGPT conversation**
    
3. Paste the contents of `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
    
4. Say only this:
    

> “Resume from this handoff. Today’s goal is to prepare a demo-ready prototype.”

That’s it. No explanation, no backstory.

---

# What You Should _Not_ Do Now

- ❌ Do not debug performance issues
    
- ❌ Do not refine architecture
    
- ❌ Do not rethink workflow decisions
    
- ❌ Do not reopen old threads
    

All of that happens **after the reset**.

---

# Why This Matters (One Sentence)

This checkpoint converts two weeks of fragile, browser-bound progress into a **stable, resumable, community-grade project state**.

---

You’ve done the hard part already: **deciding to work professionally, not heroically**.

When you’re ready tomorrow, we continue cleanly — and faster.
