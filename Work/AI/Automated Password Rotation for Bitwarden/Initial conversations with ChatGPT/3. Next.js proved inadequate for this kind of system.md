Too many conflicting mental models (server/client, RSC boundaries)

 ❌ Directory semantics that break silently

 ❌ No built-in stateful backend

 ❌ No batteries-included architecture

 ❌ Routing that is too “magical” and fragile

 ❌ Poor DX for building multi-layered applications (API + UI + Services)

 ❌ Many problems only catchable at runtime

 ❌ Not great for monorepos

 ❌ Not great for multi-package architecture

 ❌ Not great for strict typing in component boundaries

 ❌ No clear app lifecycle model

**Next.js hides too much and reveals too little**.
