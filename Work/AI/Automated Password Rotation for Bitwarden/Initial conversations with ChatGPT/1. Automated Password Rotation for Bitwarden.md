Automated Password Rotation for Bitwarden” (Colab-based)

**Project Goal**  
Build a secure automation tool that:

- Reads vault items from Bitwarden (via API/CLI)
    
- Generates new unique passwords for each login item
    
- Programmatically logs in to each target web application, navigates to the change-password flow, submits a new password
    
- Updates the Bitwarden vault item only after successful change
    
- Logs status and tracks rotation history
    
- Is structured as **Colab notebooks** (for prototyping & running) plus modular code in GitHub, so that the project can be shared with and considered for inclusion into Bitwarden as a community extension or feature.
    

**Scope & Limitations**  
In scope (v1):

- Use Google Colab notebooks for development and execution of scripts.
    
- Target a small number (~5-10) of web applications with standard login/change-password flows.
    
- Use Bitwarden’s CLI/API to list and update vault items.
    
- Use Colab to run the rotation driver notebook.
    
- Store config (sites, selectors) and logs in GitHub repository, mount/pull in Colab.
    
- Document everything (milestones, architecture, security) in GitHub + maybe notebooks for demo.
    

Out of scope (v1):

- Full enterprise rollout, massive automation across hundreds of sites without manual adaptation.
    
- Native integration inside Bitwarden UI (initially external tool).
    
- Extremely complex 2FA or custom app flows requiring heavy manual/human interaction.
    
- Production‐grade deployment outside Colab (though later you may migrate).
    

**Milestones**

|#|Milestone|Description|Target Date*|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Repo setup & Colab integration|Create GitHub private repo, set up basic folder structure, create first Colab notebook template, link repo to Colab.|Week 1|
|2|Tech stack & architecture|Decide on Python + modules for Colab, define architecture (notebook + modules + Git).|Week 2|
|3|Bitwarden integration via CLI/API|In a Colab notebook: authenticate to Bitwarden, list vault items, update a sample item.|Week 3|
|4|Web-app automation prototype (one site)|In Colab: use a browser automation library (e.g., Playwright or Selenium in Colab) to login and change password for one site.|Week 4|
|5|Rotation driver notebook|Build a Colab notebook that loops through site config, generates new password, executes automation, updates vault, logs result.|Week 5|
|6|Security hardening & rollback logic|Ensure password scripts only run securely in Colab (verify environment, secrets not exposed), implement rollback.|Week 6|
|7|Config-driven multiple sites|Extend to multiple sites via config file in repo, test at least 3 additional sites.|Week 8|
|8|Documentation & share readiness|Update README, docs, notebooks for demonstration, include usage instructions for others (Bitwarden community).|Week 9|
|9|Community engagement|Publish the project (GitHub + maybe Google Colab showcase), open issue/PR with Bitwarden community invite.|Week 10|
|10|MVP release & review|Tag version v1.0, test thoroughly in Colab, review next-steps, potential migration outside Colab.|Week 11|

*Dates approximate, adjust as needed.

**Tech Stack Options**

- **Language**: Python (since Colab uses Python notebooks out of the box)
    
- **Notebook environment**: Google Colab for development/execution; GitHub repo for modules/config/docs.
    
- **Automation library**: Use `playwright-python` or `selenium` inside Colab (need to set up Chrome/Chromedriver or headless browser).
    
- **Bitwarden integration**: Use Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) in Colab (you may need to install in notebook) or Vault Management API.
    
- **Configuration**: Store site config (YAML or JSON) in GitHub repo, mount/pull into Colab.
    
- **Logging/ledger**: Could use a CSV/JSON file in repo or Google Drive/Colab storage to track rotation status.
    
- **Version control**: GitHub repo (private) containing code, notebooks, docs, configuration. Colab notebooks saved back to repo.
    
- **Security**: Use environment variables or Colab secrets (e.g., via Google Drive encrypted file) for sensitive items.
    

**Architecture Diagram**

**Google Colab Notebook**

Pulls configuration from GitHub Repo
Bitwarden Integration Module (in notebook or imported)
- Authenticates & unlocks vault
- Lists login items
- Updates vault with new password
Site Automation Module
- For each target site config:
- Launch browser in Colab
- Login with old credentials
- Navigate to change password flow
- Submit new credentials
- Verify success
Rotation Driver Logic
- Loop through items
- Generate new password
- Run site automation
- Update vault
- log rotation outcome to ledger

**Logging & Ledger Storage**
- Write rotation results to CSV/JSON in notebook & push to repo/Drive


You can visualise this in a diagram tool and embed in the documentation.

**Security Checklist**

-  Use strong Bitwarden master password; enable 2FA on Bitwarden account.
    
-  In Colab: Do not store master password or sensitive tokens in notebook cells explicitly; use environment variables or secure vault in Google Drive.
    
-  When running Playwright/Selenium in Colab: ensure browser binary and driver are securely set up, and you remove old credentials from memory after use.
    
-  Logging: Never log actual passwords (old or new); only log status (success/fail) and site ID.
    
-  Ensure configuration files in repo do not contain plain‐text sensitive secrets.
    
-  Use GitHub repo as private; ensure notebooks do not accidentally contain credentials.
    
-  Provide rollback logic: if password change fails mid‐operation, ability to restore old password from vault and notify user.
    
-  Secure Google Drive/Colab environment: only your account, auto-logout, ensure no shared links exposing secrets.
    
-  Periodically rotate vault API tokens, CLI tokens, vault unlock keys.
    
-  Validate automation scripts before running in bulk: test in sandbox environment.
    
-  Use strong randomness for password generation: length >= 16 characters, mix uppercase/lowercase/numbers/symbols.
    
-  Backup ledger/rotation history (encrypted) offline.
    

**Repo Structure (adapted for Colab)**

`password‐rotation‐tool/   README.md   LICENSE   CONTRIBUTING.md   notebooks/       01_bitwarden_integration.ipynb       02_site_automation_sample.ipynb       03_rotation_driver.ipynb   src/       bitwarden_integration.py       automation.py       passwordgen.py       ledger.py   config/       sites.yml       .env.sample   docs/       architecture.md       security_checklist.md       milestones.md   .gitignore   requirements.txt`

- `notebooks/` holds Colab‐compatible notebooks for development and execution.
    
- `src/` holds Python modules (you can import them into notebooks).
    
- `config/` holds site config and environment variable samples.
    
- `docs/` holds spec, architecture, milestones, security checklist.
    
- Use GitHub to version everything.
    

**Community Engagement Plan**

- Prepare README with project overview, how to run in Colab, how to set up.
    
- Provide example notebook link (GitHub repo + Colab button to open notebook).
    
- Invite contributions (site adapters for new web apps).
    
- Submit an issue or PR to Bitwarden’s community forum or GitHub repo proposing this as “Community Password Rotation Add-on”.
    
- Possibly blog about the project or post on Bitwarden forum to gather users and feedback.
    
- License project under MIT (or Apache 2.0) to encourage adoption.

### 🧩 Summary: What changed vs previous spec

- Development environment is now Google Colab (instead of VS Code).
    
- Project structure and repo layout adjusted accordingly (notebooks folder).
    
- Emphasis on interactive notebooks + modules for script logic.
    
- Need to incorporate mounting GitHub repo in Colab and handling environment/credentials in Colab.
    
- Workflows remain similar: Bitwarden integration, site automation, rotation driver, logging, documentation.

If you agree with this updated specification I’ll update the Markdown template set (for Obsidian) to reflect the Colab‐based environment (not VS Code). Then we’ll proceed to **populate the Project Specification note with the full content above**. Would you like me to update the templates now?
