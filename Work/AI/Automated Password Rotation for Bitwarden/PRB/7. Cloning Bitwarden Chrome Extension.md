Here is an end‑to‑end workflow to clone, build, and run the Bitwarden browser (Chrome) extension from source. *This information is provided from Perplexity as the Bitwarden information **seemed** too convoluted*.

Note that while building the Chrome extension as described below, I encountered sveral issues as described [problems building the extension](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-vault&file=Work%2FAI%2FAutomated%20Password%20Rotation%20for%20Bitwarden%2FPRB%2F8.%20Problems%20building%20the%20Extension)

### 7.1. Clone the clients repo

- the work is done in /Users/nik/work/prb/Bitwarden folder, 
- the Chrome Extension in /Users/nik/work/prb/Bitwarden/clients/apps/browser (subfolder clients/apps/browser of Bitwarden project)
- The browser extension lives in the Bitwarden `clients` monorepo, under `apps/browser`.[1][2]

1. Clone the repo:
   - `git clone https://github.com/bitwarden/clients.git`
   - `cd clients`  (/Users/nik/work/prb/Bitwarden/clients)

### 7.2. Install prerequisites

Bitwarden’s contributing docs for the browser extension specify standard web tooling.[2]

- Install Node.js (use the version indicated in `.nvmrc` or docs; using `nvm` is recommended).  
- From the repo root, install dependencies:
  - `npm install` (or `npm ci` if you want a clean install with the exact lockfile).  
- Then go to the browser app:
  - `cd apps/browser`
    
*in reality I had several warnings to that care of * as documented in the 

### 7.3. Build/watch the extension

The browser extension build is driven by npm scripts and Webpack, outputting into a `build` directory that Chrome can load as an unpacked extension.[3][2]

1. From `apps/browser`, run:
   - `npm run build:watch`
2. This will:
   - Compile the TypeScript/Angular code.
   - Bundle via Webpack.
   - Continuously rebuild into `apps/browser/build` on changes.[3][2]

You can also do a one‑off build (if defined in `package.json`), typically `npm run build`, but `build:watch` is the usual dev workflow.[3][4]

*I used npm run build:watch:chrome and got*:

background:
 ...
  asset background.js 8.36 MiB [emitted] (name: main)
  asset 0a8f7cff25efc992da41.module.wasm 4.78 MiB [emitted] [immutable]
  asset src_platform_services_sdk_wasm_ts.background.js 65.4 KiB [emitted]
  cached modules 6.46 MiB (javascript) 4.78 MiB (webassembly) 7.15 KiB (runtime) [cached] 1655 modules
  background (webpack 5.103.0) compiled successfully in 5367 ms



### 7.4. Load the extension into Chrome

Chrome loads the local dev build from the `build` folder as an “unpacked” extension.[3][2]

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.  
2. Enable “Developer mode” (toggle in the top right).  
3. Click “Load unpacked”.  
4. In the dialog, navigate to your `apps/browser/build` folder inside the cloned repo and confirm.[3][2]
5. Bitwarden should now appear as an installed extension with the usual icon in the toolbar.

Note that being already logged into Chrome, click on the Bitwarden button resulted with Standard Bitwarden UI (loaded from chrome://extensions/)

When `npm run build:watch` is running, any code changes you make are recompiled into `build`, and Chrome will pick up updates (sometimes with a manual reload of the extension).

### 7.5. Run and test the extension

In order to be as close Bitwarden's standard development practice, I chose to run the extension extension bundling using Webpack (`npm run build:watch:chrome`)

Once loaded, you can use the extension as normal against a Bitwarden server.[5][6]

- Click the Bitwarden icon, log in or create an account (cloud or self‑hosted).  
- You can configure a self‑hosted server URL via the extension’s settings if needed.[7][8]
- To debug:
  - Go to `chrome://extensions`, find Bitwarden, and click the “background page” / “service worker” inspect link to debug background scripts.[2]
  - Right‑click the popup UI and choose “Inspect” to debug the popup window.[2]

If you want the canonical, always‑up‑to‑date instructions, Bitwarden’s contributing docs for the browser explicitly show this same Chrome build + “Load unpacked” 
workflow.[2]

Use the same terminal window that is running `npm run build:watch:chrome` and interrupt it with a signal.

### 7.6 Stop the running watch

- In the terminal where the command is “sitting there”, press **Ctrl + C** once or twice; that sends SIGINT and terminates the webpack watch process.[1][2][3]
- If it somehow gets detached (rare for `npm run`), you can find and kill it by PID, but for normal `npm run build:watch:chrome` usage, **Ctrl + C** is sufficient on macOS.[4][1]
