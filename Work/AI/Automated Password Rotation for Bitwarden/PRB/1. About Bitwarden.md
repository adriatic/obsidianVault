### How to set up a Bitwarden account step by step

To set up a Bitwarden account, first create the account in the web vault, then verify your email and log into at least one client (browser extension, desktop, or mobile).([bitwarden create account](https://bitwarden.com/help/create-bitwarden-account/))​

#### 1.1. Plan your master password

- Choose a long, unique **master** password you will remember; this is the only password you must not lose because Bitwarden cannot reset it for you.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/blog/an-introductory-guide-on-how-to-use-bitwarden-password-manager/)​
    
- Optionally decide on a master password hint that helps you recall it without revealing the password itself.[topcity+1](https://www.topcity.tech/how-to-create-a-bitwarden-account-your-new-password-manager)​
    

#### 1.2. Create the account in the web vault

- Go to the Bitwarden website and click a “Get Started” or “Sign up” entry point, which will take you to the account creation form.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/help/create-bitwarden-account/)​
    
- Enter your email address, name, master password, confirm the master password, optionally add a hint, accept the terms, and submit the form.[topcity+2](https://www.topcity.tech/how-to-create-a-bitwarden-account-your-new-password-manager)​
    

#### 1.3. Verify your email and log in

#### 1.4. Install a client (browser, desktop, or mobile)

- Install at least one Bitwarden client such as a browser extension, desktop app, or mobile app so the vault is convenient to use on your main devices.[bitwarden+2](https://bitwarden.com/browser-start/)​
    
- Open the client, log in with the same email and master password, and ensure sync is enabled so new items appear across devices.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-webvault/)​
    

#### 1.5. Add your first logins and secure the account

- In the web app or extension, create your first login item (for example, email or bank) with site URL, username, and a generated strong password, then save it to the vault.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-webvault/)​
    
- In Settings, consider enabling additional security such as two-step login (2FA) and, where available, biometrics or device-based unlock to protect access to your vault.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/help/getting-started-desktop/)​
