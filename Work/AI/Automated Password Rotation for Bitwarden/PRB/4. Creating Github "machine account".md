You create a GitHub machine account exactly like a normal user account, then dedicate it to automation and keep it within GitHub’s rule of at most one free machine account per person. Below is a concrete, step‑by‑step flow.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)

## 1. Plan the machine account

- Decide the **purpose**: CI bot, deployment bot, or other automation, and which repos/orgs it must access.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)​
    
- Choose a **distinct email and username**, e.g. `yourorg-bot` or `project-ci-bot`, not your personal email or handle.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)​
    

## 2. Create the GitHub user

- In a browser, go to GitHub’s home page and click **Sign up**.[guidde+1](https://www.guidde.com/gallery/how-to-create-a-github-account)​
    
- Enter the machine account’s email, pick a strong password, choose the bot-style username, and complete the captcha and email verification, then click **Create account**.[github.nih+1](https://github.nih.gov/start/account)​
    

## 3. Mark and secure it as “machine”

- Treat this account as a **machine user**: it must be controlled by a human, have a valid email, and be used exclusively for automated tasks, per GitHub’s Terms of Service.[dlt+1](https://www.dlt.com/sites/default/files/GitHub%20Corporate%20Terms%20of%20Service.pdf)​
    
- Enable 2FA on the account, store recovery codes in your team’s secure vault, and document that this is the official automation account for your org/project.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)​
    

## 4. Give it limited repository access

- From your personal or org owner account, add the machine account as:
    
    - A collaborator on specific repositories, or
        
    - A member of an organization with the minimum necessary role/team permissions.[notes.kodekloud+1](https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/GitHub-Actions-Certification/GitHub-Actions-in-the-Enterprise-Cloud/Github-Account-Types)​
        
- Grant only the scopes it needs (for example, read on some repos, write on a deployment repo), not full admin rights.[conductorone+1](https://www.conductorone.com/guides/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_github_access_control/)​
    

## 5. Create credentials for automation

- On the machine account, generate:
    
    - An **SSH key pair** on the automation host and add the public key under _SSH and GPG keys_, or
        
    - A **fine‑scoped personal access token (PAT)** limited to the needed permissions.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys)​
        
- Configure your CI or scripts to use that SSH key or PAT, and verify that pushes/reads appear under the machine account in commit history.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.17/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)​
    

## 6. Operate within GitHub’s rules

- Use the account only for automated tasks; do not use it as an extra personal identity, and keep to at most one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.[github+1](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)​
    
- Regularly rotate keys/tokens and audit which repos the machine account can access to maintain least‑privilege access.[conductorone+1](https://www.conductorone.com/guides/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_github_access_control/)​
    

If you share your exact use case (GitHub Actions vs external CI, personal vs org repos, SSH vs HTTPS), a concrete key/PAT and permission setup can be outlined.
