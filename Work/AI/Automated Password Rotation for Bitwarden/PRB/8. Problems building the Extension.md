Those messages mean two things: your Node/npm versions are below the repo’s declared minimum, and you have a benign ESLint peer‑dependency mismatch. The install will likely “work” but you should switch to the Node version Bitwarden expects before building or debugging.[1][2][3][4]

## 8.1. What the warnings mean

- **ESLint / rxjs‑angular warning**  
  - `eslint-plugin-rxjs-angular@2.0.1` declares a peer dependency `eslint@"^8.0.0"` but the repo is using `eslint@9.26.0`.[4]
  - That is a typical peer‑dependency warning and is safe to ignore for local builds; it only affects linting, not runtime code.[4]

- **EBADENGINE / Unsupported engine**  
  - The `@bitwarden/clients` package declares `node: ">=22.12.0", npm: "~10"` in `engines`, but you are on Node `v20.19.6` and npm `11.6.2`.[1][3]
  - This is the repo telling you “this codebase is only tested/supported on Node 22.12+ with npm 10”; using Node 20 can cause subtle build/runtime issues, especially with native modules and newer tooling.[1][3]

- **Deprecated/inflight, git dependency, etc.**  
  - These are upstream package warnings (e.g., `inflight` deprecation, git dependency skip) and are common in large JS projects; they are noisy but usually not blockers for a local dev build.[5][6]

## 8.2. Recommended fix on macOS

Given the engines declaration, the clean path is to install Node 22.12 LTS and match npm ~10 for this repo.[1][3]

1. **Install / switch Node using nvm** (recommended)  
   ```bash
   # if you don't have nvm yet
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
   # reload shell
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

   # install Node 22 LTS
   nvm install 22.12.0
   nvm use 22.12.0

   # downgrade npm to ~10 as requested
   npm install -g "npm@~10"
   ```
   This gives you a shell where `node -v` is `v22.12.0` and `npm -v` is in the 10.x range.[3]

2. **Re‑run install in the clients repo**  
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/clients
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
   With Node 22.12 and npm 10, the EBADENGINE warnings should disappear because your environment now satisfies the `engines` field.[1][3]

3. **Ignore ESLint peer‑dependency warning**  
   - You can safely ignore the `eslint-plugin-rxjs-angular` peer warning unless the repo explicitly documents a fix; it should not prevent builds or running the browser extension.[4]

Once the install completes cleanly under Node 22.12, proceed with the browser extension build (`npm run build:browser` or the documented browser script) and load the resulting `build` folder as an unpacked Chrome extension as before.[1][2]
