After agreeing the the PRB effort analyzed on Jan 3 - Jan 4 needs to focus on creation of the Chrome Extension use to verify the PRB utility in the Bitwarden Community Group, i propose the following design:

#### 9.1. PRB authentication to Bitwarden Vault 
(UI activated by a click to PRB button that is placed **next** to the Bitwarden button shown locked on the image below)

#### 9.2 Areas of the UI of interest

The browser extension icon uses assets and popup markup under `apps/browser/src/popup`, and the vault UI is primarily implemented by the Angular components in that same `popup` area. [1][2]

##### 9.3 Browser toolbar logo

For the icon shown in the browser toolbar (top‑right):

- Look at the **extension icons** defined in the manifest and assets under `apps/browser`  
  - `apps/browser/src/manifest.json` (or generated manifest template) references the icon files used by Chrome/Firefox/Safari.  
  - Image assets live under something like `apps/browser/src/assets/icons` (exact path may vary slightly with version); those are what you would replace to change the extension logo. [1][2]
- The pinned icon’s state variations (locked, unlocked, notifications, etc.) are all driven by those icon assets referenced in the manifest, not by popup HTML. [3][4]

In practice, you will:

- Inspect `apps/browser/src` for `manifest*.json` or a manifest template and see which icon paths are referenced.  
- Replace the PNG/SVG files at those paths with your own artwork (keeping the same sizes and names unless you also adjust the manifest).

##### 9.4 Vault popup UI

The vault UI that appears when you click the extension icon is built from Angular components in the `popup` module. [1][2]

Key areas to review in `apps/browser/src`:

- `apps/browser/src/popup/app.module.ts`  
  - Root Angular module for the popup; wires up the vault, lock, settings, and other popup views. [2]
- `apps/browser/src/popup/main.ts`  
  - Bootstrap entry for the popup application. [2]
- `apps/browser/src/popup/components` (or `popup/views` / `popup/modules` depending on current layout)  
  - Contains the Angular components and templates that render:  
    - Vault list and item rows  
    - Search, filters, folders, item detail panes  
    - Header area inside the popup window (if you want to alter the in‑popup logo or title separate from the toolbar icon). [1][2]
- `apps/browser/src/popup/services/services.module.ts` and related services  
  - Provides services used by the vault UI (SDK, environment, account switching, etc.); useful if your UI changes need new data or behavior. [1][2]

To customize:

- Start by searching in `apps/browser/src/popup` for strings you see in the vault (e.g., “My vault”, “All items”) to locate the exact component `.ts` and `.html` files.  
- Modify the Angular templates (`.html`) and styles (`.scss`) for your new vault layout / branding, then rebuild with `npm run build:watch` and reload the unpacked extension. [2]
