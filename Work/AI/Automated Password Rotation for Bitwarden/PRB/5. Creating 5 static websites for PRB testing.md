# WARNING - this work will be done for the release of PRB DEMO

Initial testing will be done running the Chrome extension **locally** using Nik's own vault.

Create 5 free sites that exercise “state‑of‑the‑art” authentication by combining static hosting (GitHub Pages / Netlify) with WebAuthn demo backends or self‑hosted WebAuthn demos on localhost/containers. The key is that Bitwarden only needs realistic front‑ends and real origins (HTTPS + domains), not production‑grade auth backends.[pages.github+5](https://pages.github.com/)

Since Github Pages do not support authentication -- anything that “protects” pages purely with front‑end JavaScript can be bypassed, since users can still fetch the static assets.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/z7gbly/best_way_for_newbie_to_password_protect_a_github/)​). In order to not spend money on such demo sites, we will put an auth proxy in an auth proxy in front. Most likely we will use Cloudflare ensuring that from the browser’s point of view, the origin is still your GitHub Pages domain, so Bitwarden sees a normal HTTPS site but users must authenticate to Cloudflare first.[](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/60690)

Alternatively we can consider Prebuilt GitHub Pages + Auth0 bootstrappers:

- [progrium/gh-pages-auth](https://github.com/progrium/staticsite) – Template that wires Auth0 + GitHub OAuth to a GitHub Pages site, exposing a JS API (`login`, `logout`, `isAuthenticated`, etc.).[](https://github.com/progrium/gh-pages-auth)​
    
- [progrium/authsite](https://prowebsitegroup.com/) – Similar tool (`authsite`) that configures Auth0 + Pages and deploys an auth module for use from your static SPA.[](https://github.com/progrium/staticsite)​

These give you a realistic login flow (good enough to test Bitwarden’s interaction with forms and redirects), but remember the underlying static files remain fetchable if someone bypasses the JS.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/z7gbly/best_way_for_newbie_to_password_protect_a_github/)

#### Questions to ChatGPT 

- will this approach ensure that PRB users maintain the trust in PRB???
- At some point in the future when we augment PRB to support authentications more modern than shared secrets like passwords, we would have a better look into Webauthn, which is even today supported by Bitwarden (it offers **FIDO2 WebAuthn** as a two-step login option, working with certified hardware security keys such as YubiKey, SoloKey, and Nitrokey, as well as supported platform authenticators like Windows Hello.)
- are there any "doubtful" approaches in this article on "Creating  static websites for HRB testing"
---

## What “state of the art” means here

Testing, “state of the art authentication” mainly means (note that this is initial approach trying to keep the demo version as simple as possible )

- Modern standards:
    
    - Username/password on HTTPS with secure forms.
    - 
- Realistic login flows:
    
    - Single‑page login, multi‑step login, registration, password change​


Bitwarden will interact with the browser UI and origin (scheme+host+port) rather than your actual auth backend logic, so you can safely use demo servers and fake data.[pcmag+1](https://www.pcmag.com/about/how-we-test-password-managers)​

## Step 1 – Choose free hosting

Use any mix that yields 5 distinct HTTPS origins:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) – Free static hosting per repo; ideal for 2–3 HTML‑only sites (username/password, signup, change password flows).[geeksforgeeks+2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/using-github-to-host-a-free-static-website/)​
    
- [Netlify Free plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) – Free forever tier, unlimited static sites, good for another 2–3 single‑page apps with JS calling demo APIs.[withorb+3](https://www.withorb.com/blog/netlify-pricing)​
    
- Optional: keep some WebAuthn demos only on `https://localhost` behind Docker if you want them entirely local.[github+1](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/master/webauthn-server-demo/README)​
    

Aim for e.g.:

- 3 purely static sites (HTML/CSS/JS) on GitHub Pages.
    
- 2 JS front‑ends on Netlify that talk to a WebAuthn demo backend (hosted or localhost).[pages.github+2](https://pages.github.com/)​
    

## Step 2 – Five site “roles” to test Bitwarden

Example design:

- Site 1 (static, GH Pages): Basic email/password login form to exercise capture + autofill.
    
- Site 2 (static, GH Pages): Registration + password confirmation to test generator and field mapping.
    
- Site 3 (static, GH Pages): Change‑password page to test updating entries and password history.
    
- Site 4 (Netlify or localhost): Username/password + WebAuthn registration/login using a WebAuthn demo server.[github+2](https://github.com/privacyidea/webauthn-demo)​
    
- Site 5 (Netlify or localhost): “Passwordless” WebAuthn‑only login page (no password field) to see how Bitwarden behaves when only security keys are present.[github+2](https://github.com/fido-alliance/webauthn-demo)​
    

Each has its own origin (or at least distinct subpaths) so you can test matching, domain equivalence, and different flows.[cybernews+1](https://cybernews.com/how-we-test/password-managers/)​

## Step 3 – Implement the 3 static sites (GitHub Pages)

For each of 3 GitHub repos:

- Create `index.html` with:
    
    - `<form>` using `method="post"` and realistic field names (`email`, `username`, `password`, `new_password` etc.).
        
    - Simple submit button; the action can be a dummy path (Bitwarden does not care).[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/using-github-to-host-a-free-static-website/)​
        
- Push to GitHub and enable Pages:
    
    - Repo → Settings → Pages → Source = `main` / `/root`.
        
    - Use the `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` URLs as test targets.[pages.github+1](https://pages.github.com/)​
        

These 3 sites give you realistic but safe username/password flows with zero backend.

## Step 4 – Implement 2 WebAuthn‑capable sites

Use existing WebAuthn demos instead of building the whole stack:

- [fxamacker/webauthn-demo](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn-demo) – Go‑based WebAuthn server demo running at `https://localhost:8443/` via Docker, with full registration + auth flows.[github](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn-demo)​
    
- [fido-alliance/webauthn-demo](https://github.com/fido-alliance/webauthn-demo) – Official workshop demo repo; provides a complete WebAuthn RP example.[github](https://github.com/fido-alliance/webauthn-demo)​
    
- [privacyidea/webauthn-demo](https://github.com/privacyidea/webauthn-demo) – Node‑based demo showcasing WebAuthn against privacyIDEA.[github](https://github.com/privacyidea/webauthn-demo)​
    
- [cryptoAlgorithm/webauthn-demo](https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/webauthn-demo) – Next.js WebAuthn demo; can be deployed directly to Vercel/Netlify if you want it on a public origin.[github](https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/webauthn-demo)​
    

Two patterns:

- Local‑only: run two different WebAuthn demo servers on different ports (`https://localhost:8443`, `https://localhost:3000`) and treat each as a separate “site” for Bitwarden tests.[github+2](https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/master/webauthn-server-demo/README)​
    
- Public front, local backend:
    
    - Deploy a minimal JS front‑end on Netlify that calls your local WebAuthn demo via HTTPS tunneling (e.g., `ngrok`), or
        
    - Deploy a demo like `cryptoAlgorithm/webauthn-demo` directly to a free Vercel/Netlify project to get a real public origin.[github+1](https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/webauthn-demo)​
        

These demos support FIDO2 / WebAuthn with security keys and platform authenticators, which is currently the state‑of‑the‑art browser auth mechanism.[github+2](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn-demo)​

## Step 5 – Use them with Bitwarden safely

For testing:

- Use only fake users and throwaway passwords on all 5 sites; never re‑use production credentials.[pcmag+1](https://www.pcmag.com/about/how-we-test-password-managers)​
    
- Exercise:
    
    - Capture and autofill on the static username/password pages.
        
    - Generator and policy constraints on the signup and change‑password pages.
        
    - How Bitwarden treats WebAuthn pages with or without passwords:
        
        - Does it store notes or custom fields?
            
        - How it shows entries for origins where only WebAuthn is used.[cybernews+1](https://cybernews.com/how-we-test/password-managers/)​
            
- If you self‑host Bitwarden for these tests, keep it on a separate origin and follow Bitwarden’s self‑host checklist for TLS and access control.[bitwarden+1](https://bitwarden.com/help/self-host-checklist/)


This setup gives you five no‑cost sites that cover classic password auth plus modern WebAuthn flows, with realistic origins for rigorous Bitwarden testing.[withorb+3](https://www.withorb.com/blog/netlify-pricing)​
