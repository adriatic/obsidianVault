My writing to ChatGPT

*I am not locking any design - I expect that we will do it together having some UI to trigger actions*

*My secret hope is to be able to handle some cases which the classification will tell is that they are not in the (userID / Password) class, by applying some AI functionality. This looks like a perfect case for adding AI tools to and Bitwarden folks are not supporting bulk credentials change because they are "ordinary" developers (as different from "AI app" developers)*

**ChatGPT response**

2025-12-30 12:16 PST — **LAB**

This is a healthy place to be—and your instinct here is _directionally right_, with an important caveat I’ll make explicit.

---

## First: you’re right not to lock design yet

You said:

> _“I am not locking any design — I expect that we will do it together having some UI to trigger actions”_

That is exactly the correct stance **before classification is understood**. Any UI designed _prior_ to seeing real vault diversity would be fiction. What you’re doing—letting the data push back on the design—is how non-fragile systems get built.

So: no design debt is being incurred right now. Good.

## On your “secret hope” (this is the key part)

> _“to be able to handle some cases which the classification will tell is that they are not in the (userID / Password) class, by applying some AI functionality”_

This _is_ a natural thought—and it **could** be a perfect AI use case—but only under a very specific framing.

Let me separate **what is promising** from **what is dangerous**.

## Where AI actually makes sense here

AI is _not_ good at:

- silently executing security-sensitive workflows
    
- guessing authentication semantics
    
- acting without clear success criteria
    

But AI _is_ good at:

### 1. **Interpretation and explanation**

For sites that fall outside the classic class, AI could:

- explain _why_ the site is non-classic
    
- summarize what it observed (OAuth-only, federated, multi-step, etc.)
    
- surface that information to the user clearly
    

This alone would already be valuable.

---

### 2. **Assisted classification refinement**

After initial deterministic classification, AI could:

- cluster “unknown” sites into meaningful buckets
    
- detect repeated patterns across many sites
    
- suggest _candidate_ handling strategies (never auto-apply)
    

This helps you scale understanding, not execution.

---

### 3. **Human-in-the-loop assistance (later, maybe)**

Only _after_:

- deterministic cases are rock-solid
    
- rollback semantics are defined
    
- trust boundaries are explicit
    

could AI assist in **guided execution**, e.g.:

- “This site looks similar to these 12 others where the change succeeded”
    
- “The likely change-password path is here”
    

But crucially:

> **AI suggests; PRB never assumes.**

---

## Where AI must _not_ be used (especially early)

You are absolutely right to suspect that this is where “ordinary developers” stop—but there is also a reason they stop there.

AI must _not_ be used to:

- auto-execute credential changes on unknown sites
    
- guess success
    
- infer security state silently
    
- replace explicit user confirmation
    

If PRB ever crosses into that territory, it will lose trust immediately—especially with Bitwarden users.

---

## A critical correction to one sentence (important)

You said:

> _“Bitwarden folks are not supporting bulk credentials change because they are ‘ordinary’ developers”_

I’d gently reframe that—not to soften it, but to make it accurate:

> Bitwarden does not support bulk credential change because **it would require assuming site behavior**, and Bitwarden is structurally conservative about assumptions.

That conservatism is actually a feature, not a lack of imagination.

PRB’s opportunity exists **because you are willing to explore the boundary carefully**, not because Bitwarden “missed” something obvious.

---

## The right sequencing (this matters)

Here is the sequence that keeps your hope realistic and safe:

1. **Deterministic classification (no AI)**
    
    - Use your vault
        
    - Identify classic vs non-classic
        
    - Measure coverage honestly
        
2. **Deterministic execution for classic cases**
    
    - Prove value
        
    - Build trust
        
3. **AI-assisted _understanding_ of non-classic cases**
    
    - Explanation
        
    - Grouping
        
    - Visualization
        
4. **Only then** consider AI-assisted action—and only with:
    
    - explicit user consent
        
    - reversible steps
        
    - conservative defaults
        

If you follow this order, AI becomes an _accelerant_, not a liability.

---

## Bottom line

Your “secret hope” is not naïve.  
It is **premature** only if acted on too early.

Handled the way you’re proposing—_after_ classification, _after_ understanding, _after_ trust—it could become the differentiator that makes PRB more than “bulk automation”.

For now, your current plan is exactly right:

- clone Bitwarden extension
    
- understand the real surface
    
- classify first
    
- design later
    

I’ll stay quiet and ready. When you come back with findings, we’ll decide together whether AI belongs in the next step—or should stay in the wings a bit longer.
