Here are the **extracted prompts** you can use with ChatGPT or similar LLMs to regenerate the same code and instructions for building a ChatGPT clone using RedwoodSDK, specifically focusing on the React Chat Component and its streaming logic.

## **Prompt 1: General Task Setup**

> I want to create a ChatGPT clone using the RedwoodSDK platform. Please provide a step-by-step guide, including how to implement a server function that streams AI responses and a React client component that collects user input, calls the server function, and displays the streamed AI output in real time.

## **Prompt 2: Focus on React Chat Component**

> Please provide all details on how to build the React Chat Component for this ChatGPT clone using RedwoodSDK. The component should:
> - Collect user input
> - Call the server function that streams AI responses
> - Display the AI’s streamed response in real time
> - Maintain chat history
> - Show a loading indicator while the AI is responding
> - Disable input while streaming
> Please include a complete, functional code example.

## **Prompt 3: Extracting the Streaming Logic**

> For the ChatGPT clone using RedwoodSDK, provide a code example of a React component that:
> - Uses a server function returning a ReadableStream for AI responses
> - Reads from the stream and updates the UI as new data arrives
> - Handles chat history and user/AI message distinction
> - Shows a loading indicator when the AI is typing
> - Disables input while streaming
> Please include all necessary imports and state management.

## **Prompt 4: Server Function for Streaming AI**

> Write a RedwoodSDK server function (TypeScript) that takes a user prompt, calls an AI model (such as Llama or OpenAI) with streaming enabled, and returns the response as a ReadableStream. The function should be ready to be called from a React component.

## **Prompt 5: UI/UX Considerations**

> What are the best UI/UX practices for a streaming chat interface in React? List recommendations for:
> - Loading indicators
> - Message formatting
> - Input handling during streaming
> - Chat history display

## **Prompt 6: Reference Example Projects**

> List any public example projects or guides for building a streaming AI chat app with RedwoodSDK, including links if available.

### **How to Use These Prompts**

- Use these prompts in sequence or individually with an LLM like ChatGPT.
- They will guide the model to generate the same (or very similar) code and explanations as in the previous answers.
- You can further refine the prompts for more specific requirements or customizations.

If you need these prompts tailored for a different framework or with additional features, let me know!
