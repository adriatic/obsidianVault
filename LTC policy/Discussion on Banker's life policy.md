**Perplexity states**
When you purchase a **long-term care (LTC) insurance policy** in one state (Washington) and later make claims or move to other states (Michigan, California), several **state-specific legal and regulatory issues** can affect how your policy is interpreted and administered. Here are the key considerations:

**1. Governing Law:**

- **The law of the state where the policy was issued (Washington) generally governs the interpretation of the contract**, including what is covered and what is excluded, unless the policy specifically states otherwise or unless required by another state’s public policy[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf).
    
- When you file a claim in another state (Michigan), the insurer must still honor the terms of the contract as written, but local regulations may affect administrative aspects, such as licensing requirements for care facilities or consumer protections[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf)[2](https://specifydev.uog.edu/long-term-care-insurance-michigan/).
    

**2. Facility Definitions and State Licensing:**

- **Coverage for care in a facility (like a memory care institution) often depends on how your policy defines eligible facilities**. Many policies reference state licensing or regulatory terms. For example, if your policy only covers "nursing homes" as defined by Washington law, a memory care facility in Michigan or California may or may not qualify, depending on how it is licensed in that state and how the policy defines covered facilities[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf).
    
- Courts have sometimes interpreted ambiguous policy language by looking at the licensing standards of the state where the care is provided. If your policy relies on state-specific definitions, moving to a new state could affect whether a facility qualifies for coverage[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf).
    

**3. State Consumer Protections and Policy Requirements:**

- **Washington:** Your policy is subject to Washington’s LTC insurance regulations, which set standards for coverage, preexisting conditions, and consumer protections[3](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=48.83&full=true)[4](https://www.insurance.wa.gov/insurance-resources/long-term-care/what-qualifies-long-term-care-insurance). Washington’s law does not restrict you from using benefits outside the state, but the policy terms control what care settings are covered.
    
- **Michigan:** Michigan law requires LTC policies sold as "comprehensive" to cover both facility and home care, but "home care only" policies are allowed if clearly labeled[5](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/difs/Publication/Health/FIS-PUB_5500.pdf?rev=06668d95af8748fb884dd227dcbe18c2)[2](https://specifydev.uog.edu/long-term-care-insurance-michigan/). Michigan cannot force your Washington-issued policy to provide broader coverage than the contract allows, but state law does prohibit insurers from limiting benefits based on location within the U.S. (except for Canada/Mexico)[5](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/difs/Publication/Health/FIS-PUB_5500.pdf?rev=06668d95af8748fb884dd227dcbe18c2).
    
- **California:** California has strict consumer protections for LTC insurance, including requirements that policies clearly specify covered settings (home care, nursing home, assisted living, etc.) and benefit triggers[6](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/05-health/01-ltc/ltc-insurance.cfm)[7](https://cahealthadvocates.org/long-term-care/long-term-care-insurance-an-overview/). If you move to California, your Washington policy remains governed by its original terms, but California may apply certain consumer protection laws if you need to enforce your rights or if the policy is ambiguous[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf)[7](https://cahealthadvocates.org/long-term-care/long-term-care-insurance-an-overview/).
    

**4. Portability and Claims After Moving:**

- **Most private LTC policies are portable**—meaning you can use benefits in any state, so long as the care setting meets the policy’s definitions and requirements[6](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/05-health/01-ltc/ltc-insurance.cfm)[7](https://cahealthadvocates.org/long-term-care/long-term-care-insurance-an-overview/). However, state-run public LTC programs (like Washington’s new payroll tax-based program) are not portable and only pay benefits for care received in-state[8](https://www.keenan.com/knowledge-center/news-and-insights/blogs/states-move-to-require-long-term-care-coverage/).
    
- If you move to California, the policy’s original terms will apply, but you may face challenges if the memory care institution’s licensing does not match the definitions in your Washington policy.
    

**5. Litigation and Disputes:**

- State courts may interpret ambiguous policy language differently, sometimes expanding coverage based on local licensing or consumer protection laws[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf). If a dispute arises, you may need to litigate in the state where the care is provided or where the insurer does business, and local courts may apply their own rules to resolve ambiguities.
    

**Practical Steps:**

- **Review your policy’s definitions** of covered facilities and services, and check whether they reference state-specific licensing or terms.
    
- **Consult with an attorney** experienced in LTC insurance in your current or future state, especially if your claim is denied based on facility type or location.
    
- **Ask the insurer for a written explanation** of denial, specifically referencing the policy language and the licensing status of the care facility in the state where care is provided.
    

**Summary Table: State-Specific Issues for Your LTC Policy**

|State|Governing Law for Policy|Facility Licensing Impact|State Consumer Protections|Policy Portability|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Washington|Yes (policy issued here)|Policy may reference WA licensing|Strong, but applies to WA-issued policies|Yes (private policies)|
|Michigan|No (unless policy says so)|Facility must meet policy’s definition, not MI law|MI law protects MI-issued policies, but cannot expand WA policy|Yes (private policies)|
|California|No (unless policy says so)|Facility must meet policy’s definition, not CA law|CA law protects CA-issued policies, may help in disputes|Yes (private policies)|

**Key Point:**  
_The terms of your Washington-issued policy will generally control, regardless of where you make a claim, but state licensing of facilities and local consumer protections may affect how those terms are interpreted or enforced. If your policy only covers “home care” and not institutional care, moving states will not expand your coverage unless a court finds the policy ambiguous or contrary to public policy in the new state[1](https://www.bradley.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2009/05/litigation-issues-in-long-term-care-insurance-re__/files/white-paper/fileattachment/bhm1888061v1litigationissuesinlongtermcareinsura__.pdf)[7](https://cahealthadvocates.org/long-term-care/long-term-care-insurance-an-overview/)._

If you anticipate further disputes, consult a legal expert familiar with LTC insurance and multi-state issues.
