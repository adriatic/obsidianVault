Here is a **detailed, step‑by‑step list of actions** you need to complete to register your car in California and replace your Michigan driver’s license with a California one after moving from Ann Arbor to Roseville, CA. This process is designed to be as smooth as possible, given your software engineering background.

## 1. Prepare to Establish California Residency

You are officially a California resident as soon as you move with the intent to live in the state, which is now[1].  
**Deadline**: You have **20 days** to register your car from the date you become a resident, to avoid late fees[2].
